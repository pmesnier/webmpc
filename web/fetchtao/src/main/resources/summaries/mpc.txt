Make, Project and workspace Creator (MPC) is an open source tool, developed by OCI and written in Perl. It is designed to generate a variety of tool specific project files from a common baseline. Through the powerful combination of inheritance and defaults MPC is able to reduce the maintenance burden normally associated with keeping multiple target platforms, their unique build tools, and inconsistent feature sets current.It is also easily extensible to support new build environments. The objective is to solve the prevalent problem of fragile build environments, usually experienced by developer groups, by replacing it with a singular robust build environment, and an active community of users committed to its evolution.
