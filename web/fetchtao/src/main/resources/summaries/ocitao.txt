The ACE ORB (TAO), is a CORBA V3.0 compliant, C++, object request broker. It is a second generation ORB developed with a highly extensible architecture as a result of its use of what might be termed a pattern framework, more commonly known as the ACE library. Although designed to meet the demanding requirements of hard real time systems, TAO can be easily used "out of the box" for general purpose CORBA middleware applications. Its design to meet exacting real time needs, which can be described as Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, has resulted in superior predictability, complete end to end determinism, high performance, and a scaleable implementation.
